This is the power of sectarianism that the US and the West exploits from Muslims to continue executing their \u201cDivide and Conquer\u201d policy. It is just like when the word \u201cTerrorism\u201d is mentioned anywhere, what comes to mind? Muslim, right? Same thing when Iran is mentioned, what comes to mind? I am not a Shi\u2019ah? (The writer only expresses his views with no alignment to this\u00a0sect).</p>\n<p>Almost everyone yearns for Peace in the region with diverse approaches. Besides, there are still those who have other opinions either than the Peace that people desire for. War is like a coin with two faces, whilst others abhor it, some make a living out of it. All the same, the majority wish to see Peace and Stability in the\u00a0region.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/660/1*W09Ja1OvLPQ3dpDY086Z-Q.jpeg\"><figcaption>The Irony of Arab\u00a0summits</figcaption></figure><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e0dea7cd9292\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["conflict","usa","muslim","politics","middle-east"]},{"title":"Trump\u2019s ban: Are there traitors in the Middle East?","pubDate":"2017-02-02 13:51:50","link":"https://medium.com/@sharhanalhassan/trumps-ban-are-there-traitors-in-the-middle-east-ad824e11b479?source=rss-491081c01af8------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/ad824e11b479","author":"Sharhan Alhassan","thumbnail":"","description":"\n<p>Trump\u2019s ban: Are there traitors in the Middle\u00a0East?</p>\n<p>Some protesters registering their displeasure over the ban<br>The world has been thrown into a state of confusion over the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s ban on some Muslim dominated countries which include Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen.
